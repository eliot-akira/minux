Welcome to Minux, a virtual operating system on RISC-V machine.

Networking supports HTTP/HTTPS requests, but is subject to CORS restrictions, therefore only endpoints that allow cross-origin requests will work.

Currently there is no data persistence, or import/export.

Examples:

htop                    ncdu /
df                      dmesg
nvim                    vifm
bc                      tmux
cmatrix                 sqlite3
lua hello.lua           tmux-hello-lua
qjs hello.js            tmux-hello-js
micropython hello.py    tmux-hello-py
mruby hello.rb          tmux-hello-rb
tcc -run hello.c        tmux-hello-c
